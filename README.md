## About Me

Cybersecurity has caught my interest because it's a field where logic, curiosity, and creativity come together to solve real-world problems. I'm drawn to work that challenges me intellectually--puzzles, systems, and patterns--but in a way without the emotional heaviness of more adversarial professions. Instead of arguing in courtrooms, I want to analyze, protect, and build behind the scenes. 

Cybersecurity has always fascinated me. From coding stories as a teen to becoming more informed about protecting myself from phishing and other scams. I've seen how essential digital literacy is today. As someone who used to tape over device cameras out of fear, I now want to be someone who empowers others to feel safe and informed online.

## What Inspires Me

I'm deeply motivated by women who have used cybersecurity to make change:
- **Katelyn Bowden** - turned trauma into advocacy, fighting image-based abuse and building digital resilience for others.
- **Mari Galloway** - broke barriers as a woman of color in ethical hacking and founded the Women's Society of Cyberjutsu.
- **Georgia Weidman** - whose pioneering work in penetration testing and mobile security gave women like me a blueprint for breaking into the field.
